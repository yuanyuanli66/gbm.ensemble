*******s0100: Single cell purity prediction for BRCA triple negative ***********
** s0101 -> Step1: Data preprocessing
            - Use TCGA's bulk RNAseq as training & single cell as testing
            - Standardize training & testing data 
            - Map TCGA's bulk RNAseq data with available tumor purity estimates

** s0102 -> Step2 (optional): Parameter tuning for the xgboost model from training data
            - Find best parameter combo using a grid search (this is a much smaller grid for demo purposes)
            
            #- Find the best parameter combo from an initial set of parameters
            #- Refine the parameter search grid around the current best parameter combo to see if we can do better  

** s0103 -> Step3: Predict tumor purity for the test set (single cell)
            - Build an ensemble of GBM models using TCGA bulk RNAseq data
            - Predict test set samples using each model
            - Calculated final predictions by using the average of all predictions
