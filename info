*******s0100: Single cell purity prediction for BRCA triple negative ***********
** s0101 -> Step1: Data preprocessing
            - Standardize TCGA's bulk RNAseq data together with single cell data 
            - User TCGA's bulk RNAseq as training & single cell as testing
** s0102 -> Step2: Parameter tuning for the xgboost model from training data
            - Find the best parameter combo from an intial set of parameters
            - Refine the parameter search grid around the current best parameter combo to see if we can do better  
** s0103 -> Run xgboost using all bulk RNAseq data as training & predict single cell's purity
** s0104 -> Create leave-one-out cross validation sets
** s0105 -> Run xgboost using LOO cross-validation sets
